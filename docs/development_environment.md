# Development Environment and Runtime - Fourward Programming Language

## 1. System Requirements

### 1.1 Hardware Requirements
- Minimum 2GB RAM
- 500MB disk space
- Any modern processor

### 1.2 Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for version control)
- Text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)

---

## 2. Development Setup

### 2.1 Installation
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- No additional dependencies required
- Run the interpreter using:
  ```bash
  python3 fourward_interpreter.py examples.fwd
  ```

### 2.2 Development Tools
- Python interpreter
- Code/text editor
- Git for source control
- Terminal for execution

---

## 3. Runtime Environment

### 3.1 Execution Requirements
- Python installed on your machine
- Access to terminal or command line interface
- No external libraries required

### 3.2 Environment Variables
- Not required for Fourward

---

## 4. Building and Running

### 4.1 Build Process
- No build step required
- Direct interpretation of `.fwd` source files

### 4.2 Execution
- Execute from terminal with:
  ```bash
  python3 fourward_interpreter.py <filename.fwd>
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  python3 fourward_interpreter.py examples_compatible.fwd
  ```

---

## 5. Testing Environment

### 5.1 Manual Testing
- Sample `.fwd` files included for testing
- Manual execution confirms syntax and runtime behavior

### 5.2 Future Testing Plans
- Integrate unit tests for tokenization, parsing, and interpretation
- Automate test case execution using Python's `unittest` or `pytest`

---

## 6. Debugging

### 6.1 Tools
- Print statements for tracing values
- Python traceback for catching errors

### 6.2 Techniques
- Variable inspection via print
- Step-by-step execution using logs
- Review of token streams and AST manually if needed

---

## 7. Deployment

### 7.1 Packaging
- Currently no packaging or distribution process
- Future plans may include CLI tool bundling

### 7.2 Distribution
- Project shared through GitHub repository
- Manual cloning and usage

---

## 8. Maintenance

### 8.1 Updates
- Versioning managed via Git commits
- Manual updates through pull and push operations

### 8.2 Troubleshooting
- Common issues include:
  - Unsupported syntax (e.g., unimplemented `function` blocks)
  - Typos or missing semicolons
- Use error messages and print debugging to resolve
