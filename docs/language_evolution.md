# Language Evolution - Fourward Programming Language

## 1. Initial Design Phase
- Core language concepts established
- Syntax designed for simplicity and clarity
- Feature set determined based on practical needs

## 2. Development Milestones

### Version 0.1 - Foundation
- Basic interpreter structure implemented
- Core language features:
  - Variable declarations with 'let'
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Print and input functions
  - If-else control structures
  - While loops
  - Comments support

### Version 0.2 - Feature Expansion
