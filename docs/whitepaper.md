Programming Language White Paper: Fourward
Abstract:
Fourward is a simple, easy to learn programming language that introduces beginners to important coding concepts. The language is made to be intuitive, allowing users to focus on logic and problem solving instead of the syntax. By reducing the complexity and having a clean syntax, Fourward is a good start to learn more advanced programming languages.
Purpose:
The main goal of Fourward is to make it easy to learn programming by being a language that focuses on simplicity and clarity. It is aimed at students, educators, and beginners who are new to programming and want to learn concepts without being overwhelmed by complicated syntax.
Design Philosophy:
•	Simplicity: Keep syntax and operations straightforward to minimize learning barriers.
•	Readability: Use intuitive keywords and short syntax to improve code comprehension.
•	Consistency: Maintain consistent syntax rules throughout the language.
•	Educational Focus: Prioritize fundamental programming concepts while reducing complex features.
Key Features:
1.	Simple Syntax: Statements are terminated by a semicolon, and indentation is not needed except for readability.
2.	Basic Data Types: Supports integers, floats, strings, booleans, and null values.
3.	Arithmetic and Comparative Operations: Includes standard operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison.
4.	Control Structures: Uses if, else, while, and for for control flow.
5.	Function Definition: Allows creating reusable code blocks with the function keyword.
6.	Input and Output: Simple commands like print and input enhance interactivity.
Benefits of Fourward:
•	Simple for new programmers
•	Clear and consistent syntax
•	Simple design that encourages learning
•	Provides foundational programming concepts
Comparison with Other Languages:
Compared to languages like Python and JavaScript, Fourward gets rid of advanced features that may confuse beginners. It focuses on the main aspects of programming without giving up the ability to write functional code.
Conclusion:
Fourward is made to connect beginner programmers with the coding. By offering a simple but functional language, it prepares users for more advanced languages and programming environments while developing problem solving skills and logical thinking.
