# Translator Architecture - Fourward Programming Language

## 1. System Overview
- Interpreter-based implementation
- Written in Python
- Modular design (lexer, parser, interpreter, environment)

---

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Lexer
- Converts source code into tokens
- Handles identifiers, literals, operators, and symbols
- Skips whitespace and comments

### 2.2 Parser
- Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Implements operator precedence and expression grammar
- Detects syntax errors and unexpected tokens

### 2.3 Interpreter
- Traverses and evaluates the AST
- Handles control flow, arithmetic, and variable scope
- Supports built-in functions like `print` and `input`

---

## 3. Data Structures

### 3.1 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Represents hierarchical program structure
- Used for expression evaluation and control flow
- Built from nested node classes (e.g., `BinaryOp`, `IfStatement`)

### 3.2 Environment (Symbol Table)
- Stores variable bindings across scopes
- Enables nested block evaluation
- Provides symbol resolution during runtime

---

## 4. Runtime Environment

### 4.1 Memory Management
- Python-managed memory model
- Environment class handles scoped variable storage
- No manual memory allocation or garbage collection

### 4.2 Execution Model
- Sequential execution of AST nodes
- Evaluation of expressions and statements
- Support for runtime errors and basic exception handling

---

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Key Classes
- `Token`: Represents individual lexical units
- `Parser`: Builds the AST from token streams
- `Interpreter`: Evaluates the AST
- `Environment`: Tracks variable scopes and bindings

### 5.2 Important Methods
- Tokenization using regex patterns
- Recursive descent parsing methods (e.g., `expression()`, `statement()`)
- AST evaluation methods for control flow and expressions

---

## 6. Error Handling
- Syntax errors detected during parsing (e.g., unexpected token)
- Runtime errors such as undefined variables or invalid operations
- Clear error messages with line and column information
- No error recovery mechanisms implemented yet

---

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Efficient token and AST processing
- Interpreter runs sequentially; suitable for small-scale programs
- No explicit optimization, but easy to extend

---

## 8. Extensibility
- Parser and interpreter are modular for easy updates
- Planned support for:
  - User-defined functions
  - Arrays and additional data types
  - File I/O and standard library utilities
